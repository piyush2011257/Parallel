1- Algorithmic Library

revise for coding competition
2- Advanced Tree structures- Link-Cut Tree, Segment Tree with application to dynamic queries, Treap, Splay Tree, Scapegoat Tree

revise + test
3- Multidimensional Data Indexing- Work on it to get data analysis- KD, KDB, Gtree

4- Parallel Scientific Computing- Fox, Cannon, Matrix Vector (Row / Col / Checkerboard ), SUMMA, PUMMA, Sieve of Eratosthenes

5- Parallel Computing- Sorting- Quick, Merge, Bucket, Radix, Bitonic, OddEven, Rank (Comparison of sequenctial vs parallel )

Parallelise as you study DP for competitive programming
6- Parallel Computing- Dynamic Programming- Floyd (variants), Dynamic Porgamming (LCS, LIS, Knapsack, RMQ, LCA)

After November (most probably )
7- Parallel Computing- Graph Algorithms- Floyd (variants), DFS, BFS, Connectivity, MST- Kruskal, TSP, Graph Coloring
8- Shared Memory Programming- Multicore Programming- OpenMP

start learning CUDA during semester itself
9- GPU Programming- CUDA / OpenCL- Image Processing Apllications
